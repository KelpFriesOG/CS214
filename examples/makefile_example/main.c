How to run a C program!

A) Using GCC (Tested to work with Git Bash or 
    with Powershell)

1) navigate to the makefile_example directory.

2) TYPE: gcc main.c -o outfile
    Then hit ENTER.

3) You should now see an exe file with the name 
"outfile" in the directory.

4) To execute the file type ./outfile
    Then hit ENTER.


If you use CMake or something else, I think it
is a bit overkill for the purposes of this
course. That being said, if you want to delve
into it (which I reccomend if you plan on
coding with C, C++, or C# in the long term), I reccomend
this tutorial:

Cmake is very versatile and is used in game dev,
hence why I tried (but failed) in learning it!
