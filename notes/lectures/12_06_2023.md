## Thread safe bounded Queue

- Two primary operation: we use enqueue and dequeue

We utilize the mutex to ensure sequential access to the internal data.

- **The queue threads must wait to get access to the queue**

Unresolved issues:

    What do we do if the queue is full and we try to enqueue?
    What do we do if the queue is empty and we try to dequeue?

We could just keep trying until success: "busy waiting, spinning, etc"

We introduces a new abstraction, condition variable.

- A condition variable allows us to block a thread until some condition changes
- For example we can block enqueue until the queue is not full or block dequeue
  until the queue is not empty.

In order to express this, we rely on signaling.

pthread_cond_wait - block the calling thread until the condition variable is signaled
pthread_cond_signal - signal the condition variable to unblock a thread

- **When we call pthread_wait, we remove ourself from the schedule
    and add the thread to the data structure of the waiting threads.**
