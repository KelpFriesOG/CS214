Given 5 cards what is the chance of having exactly one ace?

P(Ace) = 4 / 52
P(Not Ace) = 48 / 52

52 divided into 4 piles, what is the probability that each card contains an ace.

13 cards per pile.

2N C N / 2^(2N)

P(A | B)
Probability to roll a 3 or 4 if the roll is even.

P(B) = 1/2
P(A) = 2/6

P(A | B) = (1/6) / (1/2) = 1 / 3


Check either of the conditions
P(A and B) =  P(A) * P(B)
P(A | B) = P(A)

1 / 6 = 1/2 * 2/6 = TRUE
1 / 3 = 2 / 6  TRUE

P(10 balls added being red | drew out red ball)

P(10 balls being red) = 1/2
P(R before added) = 1/2
P(R given R balls were added) = 2/3
P(R given B balls were added) = 1/3

(0.5 * 2/3) / (0.5 * 2/3 + 0.5*1/3)

= 2 / 3

P(cell phone while driving) = 2/3
P(accident | use cell phone) = 0.05
P(accident | not using phone) = 0.01

Question: P(using cell phone | accident)

P(accident | using cellphone) = P(accident AND using cellphone) / (P(using a cell phone))

0.05 = P(accident AND using cellphone) / (2/3)

0.05 * (2/3) = P(accident AND using cellphone)

P(accident | using cell phone) = P(accident AND not using cell phone) / P(using cell phone)

0.01 = P(accident AND not using cell phone) / (2/3)

0.01 * 2/3 = P(accident AND not using cell phone)


P(using cell phone | accident) = P(using cell phone AND accident) / (P(accident AND not using cell phone) + P(accident AND using cellphone))

= (0.05 * (2/3)) / (0.05 * (2/3) + 0.01 * 2/3)

P(upper side being BLACK) = 1/2
P(upper side being RED) = 1/2 
P(upper side being RED | GREEN card) = 1/2
P(upper side being BLACK | GREEN card) = 1/2

P(GREEN card) = 1/3


Question: P(upper side BLACK | upper side RED)
