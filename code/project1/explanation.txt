So this is basically a run down of expectations!

For this assignment we are trying to create our own custom implementations
of malloc() and free().

As a recap, we use malloc to allocate space on the heap.
We want to allocate space on the heap because it the space
we allocate their is more versatile and the stuff we store
stays there after the program ends!

We use free to take a given pointer and "free" the memory
it points to. This DOES NOT remove or add memory to our
program, nor does it reset any bytes.

Instead the memory is untouched, but now is marked as
free. This means that C understands that the memory
is no longer special or reserved and it may choose to
overwrite that memory space at any given time!

Lets create the project files

After doing that, read the project pdf and put in the
bare minimum requirements.

As suggested by the project instructions,
the best approach here is to store "chunks"
in the memory array. Each chunk will be
an object which contains some key data!

Every chunk will have a:

-> Size
-> A pointer to the next chunk
-> and a boolean (in this case an int) indicating
if the chunk is free or not!

Lets make this chunk!
