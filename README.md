# CS214

Heyo, this repository is pretty barren at the moment, expect it to fill up
in the coming semester.

In this repo I will be sharing resources related to CS-214 including
but not limited to:

- lecture notes
- self study notes
- code (I assume in C), including projects
- homework assignments
- any exam / quiz materials

Most people like summarizing, I like expounding. Please keep that
in mind when you see my messy and overcomplicated notes.

The important stuff is highlighted, and stuff covered in any exam
or quiz related to the chapter / lecture is explicitly re-emphasized
in the post-breakdown or study guide for each chapter.

Grades I recieved for assignments will be shown as well as errors
I made. How to resolve those errors will be up to you!

This course is hard, I do not expect 100 (expect a B at best), 
and I hope prospective students understand that it is difficult 
to keep up and stay on top of things.

- If you can't keep up, then start early and stay ahead.
- This gives you some breathing room if and when you want to chill.
- And more importantly you have insight on what you will struggle with
understanding in the upcoming lectures or exams.

When using these materials, keep in mind the [Rutgers University's Principles of Academic Integrity](http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/) and the [Rutgers Department of Computer Science's Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity/introduction).

**I.E. Don't cheat, and don't expect these notes to carry you
through the whole semester. (Because you gotta commit to reading
and understanding them which is a whole lot of effort).**
